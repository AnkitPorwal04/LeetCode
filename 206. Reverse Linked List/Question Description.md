206. Reverse Linked List

Easy Topics Companies

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:

![rev1ex2](https://github.com/AnkitPorwal04/LeetCode/assets/96345105/01ad32d6-6674-4c30-b0d8-f0c1c497c984)

Input: head = [1,2]

Output: [2,1]

Example 3:

Input: head = []

Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].

-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
