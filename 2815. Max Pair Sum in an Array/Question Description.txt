2815. Max Pair Sum in an Array

Easy Topics Companies

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You have to find the maximum sum of a pair of numbers from nums such that the maximum digit in both numbers are equal.

Return the maximum sum or -1 if no such pair exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [51,71,17,24,42]
Output: 88
Explanation: 
For i = 1 and j = 2, nums[i] and nums[j] have equal maximum digits with a pair sum of 71 + 17 = 88. 
For i = 3 and j = 4, nums[i] and nums[j] have equal maximum digits with a pair sum of 24 + 42 = 66.
It can be shown that there are no other pairs with equal maximum digits, so the answer is 88.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: No pair exists in nums with equal maximum digits.
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 104
