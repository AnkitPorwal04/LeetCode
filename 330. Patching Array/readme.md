The problem "330. Patching Array" is about ensuring that we can represent every number in the range `[1, n]` using the numbers from the array `nums`, possibly with some additional numbers (patches). The goal is to find the minimum number of patches needed.

### Explanation of the Code

Here's the code for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def minPatches(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> int:
        miss, added, index = 1, 0, 0
        while miss <= n:
            if index < len(nums) and nums[index] <= miss:
                miss += nums[index]
                index += 1
            else:
                miss += miss
                added += 1
        return added
```

#### Variables:
- `miss`: Represents the smallest number that cannot be formed using the current numbers in `nums` and any numbers added so far.
- `added`: Counts the number of patches (numbers added to `nums`) needed.
- `index`: Points to the current position in the `nums` array.

#### How the Code Works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `miss` is initialized to `1` because we start by trying to form the number `1`.
   - `added` is initialized to `0` because no patches have been added initially.
   - `index` is initialized to `0` to start from the beginning of the `nums` array.

2. **Loop until `miss` exceeds `n`**:
   - The loop continues as long as `miss` is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that we can form all numbers up to `n`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - **If `index` is within bounds and `nums[index]` is less than or equal to `miss`**:
     - This means the current number in `nums` can be used to form the number `miss`.
     - Add `nums[index]` to `miss` (i.e., `miss += nums[index]`), effectively expanding the range of numbers that can be formed.
     - Move to the next number in the array by incrementing `index`.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - If the current number in `nums` is greater than `miss` or we have exhausted all numbers in `nums`, we need to add a patch.
     - Add `miss` to itself (i.e., `miss += miss`), effectively doubling the range of numbers that can be formed. This ensures we can form the next smallest number.
     - Increment the `added` counter since we've added a patch.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Once the loop exits, `added` contains the minimum number of patches needed to ensure all numbers from `1` to `n` can be formed.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through an example:

- `nums = [1, 3]`, `n = 6`.

**Initial State**:
- `miss = 1`, `added = 0`, `index = 0`.

**Iteration 1**:
- `nums[0] = 1` (which is `<= miss`).
- `miss = 1 + 1 = 2`, `index = 1`.

**Iteration 2**:
- `miss = 2`, `index = 1`, `nums[1] = 3` (which is `> miss`).
- Patch needed: Add `miss` to itself, `miss = 2 + 2 = 4`, `added = 1`.

**Iteration 3**:
- `miss = 4`, `index = 1`, `nums[1] = 3` (which is `<= miss`).
- `miss = 4 + 3 = 7`, `index = 2`.

**Exit Condition**:
- `miss = 7` which is greater than `n = 6`.

**Result**:
- `added = 1`.

So, only 1 patch is needed to ensure all numbers from `1` to `6` can be formed using the array `[1, 3]`.

### Summary
The algorithm leverages the property of the smallest unformed number (`miss`) and iteratively ensures all numbers up to `n` can be formed by either using the existing numbers in the array or adding the necessary patches. This greedy approach guarantees the minimum number of patches required.
