Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.


Example 1:

![leftsum-tree](https://github.com/AnkitPorwal04/LeetCode/assets/96345105/17d41c06-ffc5-41db-b025-e7d1dbad4c10)

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: 24

Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]

Output: 0
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
