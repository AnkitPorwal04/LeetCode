Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


Example 1:

![lc-midlist1](https://github.com/AnkitPorwal04/LeetCode/assets/96345105/705d00c2-745e-4e8b-9073-c5886eeba882)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [3,4,5]

Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:

![lc-midlist2](https://github.com/AnkitPorwal04/LeetCode/assets/96345105/80a2ade1-ad09-4bf7-b143-363c88b11799)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: [4,5,6]

Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].

1 <= Node.val <= 100
